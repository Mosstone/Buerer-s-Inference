Prerelease.

A radial chart indicating the relationship between every possible form of a value in predicate logic, allowing for a logician to immediately and accurately see every possible implied form without a long sequence of steps to infer the relationship between two forms

Expressed in forms usable for set theory and computational analysis, this is expected to show hightened efficiency in both contexts. Takes into account assumptions made about the set and the value being evaluated.
