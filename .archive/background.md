This is the chart that I wrote during college to get an A in symbolic logic several years ago. The professor asked to have the chart and then retired, so I just never the chart back or was able to make a copy

This is a reconstruction of it, standardized slightly and posted along with refactored derivatives for use in mathematics and computer science

In the original chart, each possible form was arranged in a circle with a double line drawn between known relationships. The direction of an implication was indicated by whether the left line, from the perspective of the base form, was solid line or a dashed line. ∀x φ(x) implies ∃x φ(x) so |¦ was drawn from the universal to existential truth. Based on that you know that universal implies existential but existential does not imply universal because from the perspective of the existential the line on the left would be dashed and therefor untraversable.

The rules of inference only established a small number of relationships. I used a hypothetical syllogism to close the chained implications, drawing vectors between nearly every combination of forms until no unrepresented relationships remained.

The resulting chart contained three distinct arcs, each representing a different domain and three distinct forms. The universal domain (simply called domain in textbooks) represents, the set or subset arc, and the singleton arc

The singleton arc are all logically equivalent since obviously one of something, all of something, and the something itself are all equivalent when there is exactly one of something are all the same. This is mostly relevant in identifying when a singleton has been isolated and can be collapsed to just φ. It could also be used for computer science if you need to make sure that there isn't a mismatch in a value, which would indicate mutation of the value (for ECC systems)
